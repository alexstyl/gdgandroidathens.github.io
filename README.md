## Creating a Pull Request
Everyone is free to create a Pull Request to change anything they like in the web site. Creating a PR is really simple. There is only one `master` branch which you can branch off and make any sort of changes you like. When you are done with the changes open a PR against `master`. Make sure to mention what exactly your PR does and some reasoning behind it.
